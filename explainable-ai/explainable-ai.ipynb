As synthetic data is not restricted by privacy, this allows to engage with far broader groups and communities, when it comes to algorithmic auditing, and ensuring the safety of developed ML-powered systems.\n",

As the latter is not privacy-sensitive, this allows to have these types of introspections and validations performed by a significantly larger group of stakeholders. This is a key part to build safe & smart algorithms, that will have a significant impact on individuals' lives."
